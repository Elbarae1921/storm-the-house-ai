This project was inspired by [CodeBullet's Storm The House video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fURH8z3hb6Y&ab_channel=CodeBullet)

Basically what it does is play Storm The House for you. It's not perfect, it cannot reload itself it needs some help clicking the spacebar, it also can't upgrade ammunition and weapons. I did write it a long time ago so bugs and crashes are to be expected :).

All you need to do is open the project in Visual Studio and run it (I think). But in order for it to actually work you need to change the coordinates according to your screen.
